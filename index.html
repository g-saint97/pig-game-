        <h1>The Rules of Pig game 😍</h1>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>The game is played with two players. </li>
            <li>On each turn, a player rolls a
              six-sided die as many times as they want, and each roll's value is
              added to their turn total.</li>
            <li>However, if the player rolls a 1 on any of
              their rolls, their turn ends immediately, and they lose all the points
              they accumulated during that turn. It is then the other player's turn.</li>
            <li>A player can choose to "hold" their turn at any point, at which point
              their turn total is added to their overall score. It then becomes the
              other player's turn. </li>
            <li>The first player to reach a score of 100 or more
              points wins the game. </li>
            <li>If both players reach 100 points or more in the
              same turn, the player with the higher score wins.</li>
            <li>If a player rolls a 1 on their first roll of their turn, they score no points, and their
              turn ends immediately. It then becomes the other player's turn. </li>
              <p>These
                are the basic rules of the game. In the digital version of the game
                you linked to, there may be additional features or variations, but
                these rules should still apply.</p>
